Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.

I'd hoped to implement dynamic routing and endpoints with descriptive terms however had issues when using them with SQL queries and joining and so replaced them with a direct reference to the id numbers, which should have been something that could have been handled.

When mapping posts it took id from category table to use as the key when using item.id, rather than from posts. chainging the column name solved this problem, but not sure why the confusion occured or was included due tothe join. ight be possible to write in a way which defines the table we want it from when using it in the mappingm but went with this method to fix.
